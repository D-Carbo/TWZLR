TWZLR Interface
    Room for improvement:
        - Add functionality to save and load part lists
        - Add functionality to read base ranges directly from NCBI and not require user to input them (this is main bottleneck)
        - Add functionality for ciruclar insertion into chromosome
        - Add proper adapter functionality


    Possible Errors:
        - If user reopens setting configuration interface and makes changes, the parameters will not recheck and could throw an Errors
        - range of insertion must have a lower integer in the first element of the tuple,
        - index of homology arms could run off of index of chromosome throwing error
        - base ranges for genes must have a lower integer in the first element of the tuple
        - insertion of parameters of negative value anywhere will throw Error
        - Sequencing algorithm can be finnicky 
        - in main interface, placing indexes out of list range and attempting to add component will throw error
